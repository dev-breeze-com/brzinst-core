    [1;31;40m--------------------------- [1;37;40mPackaging system[1;31;40m ---------------------------

    Our proprietary packaging system, Breeze::OS PackagerÂ©Â® uses a
    zip-derived archive format, which includes the following entries:
       mimetype,
       meta.xml,
       depends.xml,
       manifest.xml,
       settings.xml,
       private.xml,
       archive.[xz|txz|tlz|tbz|tgz|deb]
       archive.sig

    The contents of the compressed archive are taken from distributions;
    such as, slackware, debian, freebsd, netbsd, etc..

    The compressed archive of the packages can be extracted and re-used by
    packaging systems other than the Breeze::OS packager; since they are
    archived as downloaded from their respective websites. The original hash 
    signatures of the downloaded archives are kept in the 'meta.xml' file.

    The source code consisting of shell scripts, in the Breeze::OS package
    installer fall under the GNU GPL license.
