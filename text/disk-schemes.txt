                           [1;37;40mschemes [0;37;40m.
 The [1;37;40mfirst scheme [0;37;40m uses the [1;37;40mwhole drive [0;37;40m for a
                      [1;37;40msingle [0;37;40m partition.
       The others consist in partitioning the drive, the following way:

    a [1;32;40m/ [0;37;40m [1;37;40mroot [0;37;40m partition,
    a [1;32;40m/usr [0;37;40m partition for installation,
    a [1;32;40m/home [0;37;40m partition for user files, and
    a [1;32;40m/share [0;37;40m partition, as a [1;37;40mcommon [0;37;40m area.

The remaining schemes include an existing [1;32;40m/windows[0;37;40m partition.

    The [1;37;40mrecommended [0;37;40m scheme is [1;32;40mroot home usr [0;37;40m.
