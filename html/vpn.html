You <b>must</b> have a dynamic domain name service <font color="#33FB01">(DNS)</font> account, so that you can communicate<br>with other people on the Internet. A dynamic DNS account is <b>not</b> required, if you have<br>a <b>static</b> Internet <font color="#33FB01">IP address</font> from your Internet service provider.
</p>
<p align="center">
Once you have a dynamic DNS account, you can then use your dynamic DNS address
to communicate with friends and colleagues. When creating your account; you
must provide the fully qualified domain name, consisting of host and domain
names; as well as, username and password.
</p>
<p align="center">
You can communicate by simply using the dynamic DNS address to issue requests; or,<br>by creating <font color="#33FB01">virtual clubs</font> with limited access to peers.
Your <font color="#33FB01">dynamic DNS address</font> is used as<br>your <b>publicly visible</b> fully qualified domain name <font color="#33FB01">(FQDN)</font> on the <b>Internet</b>.
