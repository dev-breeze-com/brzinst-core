volume group
    In LVM a volume group (VG) is, a set of physical volumes. All physical volumes in a volume group should have the same extent size. It is from the volume group that you actually allocate extents to created your logical volumes (see below). If you have 2 VGs each holding two 250GB physical volumes (say 250GB hard disks) then you could create, at most, two logical volumes each 500GB in size. Alternatively if you had a single VG holding all four of your 250GB PVs you could create yourself a single 1TB logical volume. Note that you don't have to just create a single LV for each VG, in these examples you could create say eight 128GB LVs, or 16 64GB LVs.
